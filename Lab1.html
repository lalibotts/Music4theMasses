    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    <p>
        We used to chase that Chattanooga fray<br>
        Couple a kids in a Chevrolet<br>
        Catch a little air when we cross the tracks<br>
        Sipping on something from a paper sack<br>
        You hang your shirt on that maple lamp<br>
        Slipping through the moon to the river bend<br>
        Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in<br>
        I guess I'm still doing now, what I was doing then<br>
        <br>
        Chasing you, like a shot of whiskey<br>
        Burning going down, burning going down<br>
        Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights<br>
        Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town<br>
        <br>
        Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon<br>
        Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view<br>
        Hell, I'm laying every night holding someone new<br>
        Still chasing you, still chasing you<br>
        <br>
        You always used to talk about L.A<br>
        I heard you got as far as Santa Fe<br>
        Oh wait, you know I tried to track you down<br>
        I only got as far as guitar town<br>
        Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know better<br>
        Haven't given' up, I'm just on your radio<br>
        <br>
        Chasing you, like a shot of whiskey<br>
        Burning going down, burning going down<br>
        Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights<br>
        Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town<br>
        <br>
        Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon<br>
        Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view<br>
        Hell, I'm laying every night holding someone new<br>
        Still chasing you, still chasing you<br>
        <br><br>
        Chasing you, like a shot of whiskey<br>
        Burning going down, burning going down<br>
        Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights<br>
        Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town<br>
        Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon<br>
        Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view<br>
        Hell, I'm laying every night holding someone new<br>
        Still chasing you, still chasing You<br>
        <br>
        Still chasing you, still chasing you
